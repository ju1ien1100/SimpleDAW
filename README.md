# Julien's Personal Project

## Accessible Audio Editing

Intentions of the project:
- Software which can be used for audio **editing** and **creation**
- The software should be comprehensible and accessible for people of all ages and abilities to use. Similar to p5.js 
for coding this software should be educational and allow users to explore audio editing. 
- A developed suite of tools for audio processing and a way for users to add/create their own tools.



For my personal project I hope to continue the intersection between music and technology
which I have been working on for the past year. For this course, I will be starting the creation
of a new software for audio editing which aims to create more accessible audio editing software
which abstracts many complex processes which users face in software's such as Abelton or FLstudios away, 
such as managing audio levels and layering audio to create a more full sound. This aims to be an educational tool
for learning how to use more advanced software and therefore should be accessible, have ease of use, and is inviting
to users. 

Given that this is an iterative process the first part will be creating the command
line tool which will be for the editing and creation of audio files. It will be able to display all
the available sounds and the user can input a custom order. This will be first for note so that they can create
measures and then, with those measures they can input the order of different ones created by the user. After making an
arbitrary amount of measures and composing them, when the user is done it will output and save the file. 
The user would have a collection of songs, which is a collection of measures, which are collections of notes/sounds. 

Once we are onto the graphical interface I will create a view for editing the measures, creating new measures, and 
adding notes to those measures. In the aims to be education it will also come with many prompts
and indicators of what should be done/ can be done.
